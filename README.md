# What is this repo about?

<br/>

this is my personal projects repo, where i store all my projects, from the most recent to the oldest. i also store some of my old projects that i don't want to delete, but i don't want to show them to the public.

remeber you can read all the documantation of each project in the readme.md file of each project.


*Just a tip*: if you want to see the code of a project, just click on the image of the project, and you will be redirected to the github page of the project.
